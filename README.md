# Scholarship-Portal

Developed  a E-scholarship portal for students 

The initiative aims at providing a Simplified, Mission-oriented, Accountable, Responsive & Transparent 'SMART' System 
for faster & effective disposal of Scholarships applications and delivery of funds directly 
into beneficiaries account without any leakages. Scholarships Portal is one-stop solution through 
which various services starting from student application, application receipt, processing, sanction
and disbursal of various scholarships to Students are enabled. National Scholarships Portal is taken 
as Mission Mode Project under National e-Governance Plan (NeGP). Currently, the NSP has 9 participating
ministry/departments and 21 registered schemes. The application was developed using Hypertext pre-processor
(PHP), AJAX, JavaScript, Hyper Text Mark-up Language (HTML) as the front end and
MySQL database as the backend. The E-scholarship system provides online application solutions
that save time, and sends notifications using SMS alerts and emails on the progress of application in a timely and transparent manner.
